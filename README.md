# odata-modeller

A tool reads an OData Service's metadata XML, and generates a nice graphical representation of it.

Useful for creating documentation, or for help in understanding how a service's entities are structured.

You can download, build and host your own, or you can use the hosted version: https://bradzacher.github.io/odata-modeller/
